# Matlab - Quadratic Equations

Pragmatic examples on how to solve quadratic equations with Matlab. The project includes methods for graphical, symbolic and numeric solutions to quadratic equations. 

The user will have to input three constants (a,b,c) for the quadratic equation:

**ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0**

Here is an example on how to identify the constants:

x<sup>2</sup> - 3x - 10 = 0

a = 1,  b = -3, c = -10
